  abstract = "Tissue fibrosis is a major cause of mortality that results from
              the deposition of matrix proteins by an activated mesenchyme.
              Macrophages accumulate in fibrosis, but the role of specific
              subgroups in supporting fibrogenesis has not been investigated in
              vivo. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to
              characterize the heterogeneity of macrophages in
              bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in mice. A novel computational
              framework for the annotation of scRNA-seq by reference to bulk
              transcriptomes (SingleR) enabled the subclustering of macrophages
              and revealed a disease-associated subgroup with a transitional
              gene expression profile intermediate between monocyte-derived and
              alveolar macrophages. These CX3CR1+SiglecF+ transitional
              macrophages localized to the fibrotic niche and had a profibrotic
              effect in vivo. Human orthologs of genes expressed by the
              transitional macrophages were upregulated in samples from
              patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Thus, we have
              identified a pathological subgroup of transitional macrophages
              that are required for the fibrotic response to injury.",
